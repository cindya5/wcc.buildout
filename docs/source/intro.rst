Source code
------------

At the moment the source codes are located in
http://github.com/inigoconsulting/ with names that starts with ``wcc.``. The
sources will later be moved to http://github.com/oikoumene/ after code are more
stable.

The buildout git repository is currently located separately in
http://dev.inigo-tech.com/git/wcc.buildout.git/ as it might contain information
which shouldnt be easily accessible from google search.
